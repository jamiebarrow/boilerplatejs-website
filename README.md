![BoilerplateJS - JavaScript Reference Architecture](./images/logo.jpg)

## Introduction ##
This repository is for the BoilerplateJS documentation website, which used to be hosted in the past at:

http://boilerplatejs.org

See also the main repository at:

https://github.com/jamiebarrow/boilerplatejs

Which is a fork of the original repository:

https://github.com/99x/boilerplatejs)

## Opening the website ##
It is best to view the website by loading it in an actual HTTP server.

The repository currently makes use of the `http-server` npm package to do this, just clone the repo and run:

```shell
$ npm start
```

This will start a development server to host the docs and open your default browser, likely on `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
